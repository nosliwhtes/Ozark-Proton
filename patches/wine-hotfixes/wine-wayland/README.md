# EM-11 patch import

## Bleeding-edge refresh (2026-09-22)

Current validated Wine base: `1c78596625336a73dbfc035dbbcf0dbdd95b06eb`.
The EM import snapshot below is unchanged. Imports 0295 and 0296 now live in
`../disabled/`, because Wine includes Remi Bernon's fixes as `a16c7d16e5b`
and `15b9d161776`. Preserve the base's constructor/alias signature and avoid
duplicating its returnedonly property. See the disabled README for provenance.

The accompanying GE video rebase refreshes the old GStreamer parser deletion
over Conor McCarthy's `3cd4638c4dc` read-buffer change and fixes blank-line
context in video patch 0062. The FFmpeg replacement and the non-seekable live
source behavior remain enabled; no video fix is dropped.

A clean isolated checkout replayed all 774 GE Wine patch entries and the
selected automatic Wine-staging patches in prep order without failures,
skipped patches, or rejects. The two rebased video patches applied with zero
fuzz. The affected live source files match that replay. No autoconf, source
generators, builds, or runtime tests were run.

Existing patch numbers are retained for review. There are 285 active patches
in this directory; gaps are intentional. Unused imports are kept under
`../disabled/` with their original author headers.

## New commits

The update adds 13 active patches from the 15 new EM commits below. Authors,

Patch 0196 was refreshed from EM commit
`795110c914208386ebaa13c5f45065661e004c3d`. It now initializes the shared
Win32u window-state callback output. The older, separate 0190 initialization
patch is disabled rather than applying both versions.

## Integration boundaries

The prep script applies this directory first, then GE's SNI patch
(`../em-fixups/0001`), then `../wineland-child-rendering/`, then the remaining
GE EM fixups. Wine-staging and the remaining Wine patches follow in their
existing order. The script is the authoritative application order.

Erhan Bilgili's Wine-Wineland cross-process DMA-BUF/EGL composition and SNI
work remains in use, with its author credit and source references preserved.
The overlapping EM offscreen/readback implementation remains disabled.
Wine-Wineland's native Steam-overlay implementation is not imported; GE's
existing overlay bridge and layer remain separate from Wine-Wayland.

Important rebase resolutions:

- Retain EM output enter/leave tracking and activation changes alongside
  Wineland surface state. Output-placement hints must not overwrite an
  already queued Win32 geometry or foreground-state update.
- Invalidate Wineland's cached size limits inside EM's new state-change
  conditional. Preserve GE's exact-aligned popup fallback after EM's
  separate left/above owner probes.
- Do not restore the old implicit thread-input attachment in
  `set_parent_window`, which the new Wine base removed.
- Preserve the GE Unix-only dispatcher and new upstream ARM64/ARM64EC signal
  handling. Keep EM's dispatcher thread name in the Unix entry point.
- `../em-fixups/0048` integrates output-reference cleanup and startup-token
  lifetime checks for the combined surface lifecycle. It credits the EM
  commits it adapts and does not add an overlay or change activation policy.
- Retain both EM and GE KMT adapter-information cases. Rebase FSR, WineOpenXR,
  and NVIDIA latency changes without dropping the current producer locking;
  latency submit information is attached before the actual queue submission.
- Keep the existing GE FFmpeg media and Sony controller stacks. Repair
  malformed hunk counts and short-context diffs so GNU patch applies their
  complete changes. Deduplicate overlapping media fields/drain logic and the
  controller hotplug delta documented in `../disabled/README.md`.

Four manually applied Wine-staging sets now live in GE-owned directories
under `../wine-staging/`: `ntdll-Hide_Wine_Exports`, `kernel32-Debugger`,
`ntdll-ext4-case-folder`, and `winex11-Window_Style`. This preserves their
rebased context without modifying the Wine-staging submodule. Their original
patch authors are retained.

## Original Snapshot Validation

A clean, isolated replay on the pinned Wine base applied all 909 Wine patch
entries in prep order. GE/manual patches were checked and applied with GNU
`patch --fuzz=0`; automatic Wine-staging entries used `git apply`, matching
the staging installer backend. The resulting source tree matched the
resolved rebase tree exactly. The prep script passed `bash -n`.

The 19 component patch entries for DXVK, VKD3D-Proton, protonfixes,
low_latency_layer, WineOpenXR, Steam/UMU helpers, lsteamclient, and Wine-Mono
also applied with zero fuzz in separate clean snapshots. OptiScaler 0001 and
lsteamclient 0003 needed only diff-context normalization, not logic changes.
Wine-Mono was checked against the affected files from its pinned 11.2.0
source archive; no checksum pass was performed.

No builds or runtime tests were run. The working Wine and Wine-staging source
checkouts and unrelated component modifications were left untouched. Build
and runtime verification are still required, particularly window activation,
multi-output placement, child-process launchers, fullscreen transitions, and
the existing overlay/controller/media workflows.
